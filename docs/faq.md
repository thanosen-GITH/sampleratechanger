# FAQ

## Does this resample audio?

No. Only the header is changed.

## Why would I want this instead of resampling?

Some files are recorded or labeled incorrectly. Changing the header can fix them instantly without processing audio.

## Can this damage my files?

The tool edits headers only, but any in-place modification carries risk. Backups are recommended.

## Is this suitable for batch processing?

Yes. You can process up to 2048 files in one invocation.
